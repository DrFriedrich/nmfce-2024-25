###W09-W1_parta_start_md
**Solution:** The square

**Proof:**
- Draw on the board a sketch of rectangle, name sides a, b
    - Perimeter: P = 2(a+b)
    - Surface Area: A = ab
- Formal problem: max {ab}
    - s.t. P=2(a+b)
- Name P/2 = Q, so b = Q-a, and objective becomes: max { a(Q-a) } = max { aQ-a^2 } = max J
- Critical point: J' = dJ / da = 0, or Q - 2a*= 0, so a* = Q/2 = P/4
- Substituting: b* = Q - a* = Q - Q/2 = Q/2, so a* = b*, which implies a square by definition.
- The maximum objective thus is: J* = a*Q - a*^2 = Q^2/2 - Q^2/4 = Q^2/4 = P^2/16
- SOLUTION IS INCOMPLETE without checking the sign of the 2nd derivative at the critical point!
    - J'' = d^2J/da^2 = (aQ - a^2)'' = (Q-2a)' = -2 < 0. So J'' (a=a*) < 0 (as everywhere), thus maximum.

###W09-W1_partb_start_md
**Solution:** The square

**Proof:**
- Draw on the board a sketch of rectangle, name sides a, b
    - Perimeter: P = 2(a+b)
    - Surface Area: A = ab
- Formal problem: min {a+b} (we can simplify by neglecting the const. term two=2)
    - s.t. A = ab (thus, b = A/a)
- The univariate objective becomes: min { a + A/a } = min J
- Critical point: J' = dJ / da = 0, or 1 - A/a*^2 = 0, so a* = A^0.5 = sqrt(A)
- Substituting: b*= A/(A^0.5) = A^0.5 = sqrt(A), so a* = b*, which implies a square by definition.
- The minimum objective thus is: J* = ( a* + b* ) = 2.sqrt(A), and for actual P* = 4.sqrt(A)
- SOLUTION IS INCOMPLETE without checking the sign of the 2nd derivative at the critical point!
    - J'' = d^2J/da^2 = (a + A/a)'' = (1 - A/a^2)' = 0 + 2A/a^3 > 0 (a > 0) So J'' (a=a*) > 0, thus minimum.

###W09-W1_partc_start_md
**Solution:** The cube

**Proof:**
- Draw on the board a sketch of this shape (simple box), name sides a, b, c (unequal)
    - Total external surface area S = 2( ab+bc+ac )
    - Volume V = abc
- Formal problem: max { abc }
    - s.t. S = 2 ( ab+bc+ac )
    - setting Q = S/2, c becomes: c = (Q-ab)/(a+b)
- Therefore, the volume objective becomes: J = V = ab(Q-ab)/(a+b) = (Qab - a^2b^2)/(a+b)
- Critical point: we must determine a* and b* by setting both Jacobian elements to zero:
    - dJ/da = 0, so: [ (Qb - 2ab^2)(a+b) - (Qab - a^2b^2) ] / (a+b)^2 = 0
- Therefore: (Qb - 2ab^2)(a+b) = (Qab - a^2b^2) (we omit the stars at a* and b*, for clarity)
- dJ/db = 0, so: [ (Qa - 2a^2.b)(a+b) - (Qab - a^2b^2) ] / (a+b)^2 = 0
- Therefore: (Qb - 2ab^2)(a+b) = (Qab - a^2b^2) (we omit the stars at a* and b*, for
clarity)
- Factorising the two equations and dividing by parts, we get at critical point: 1 = a/b, so a*=b*
- Substituting then back into the c expression: c = (Q-a^2)/(2a), and then in either of the two equations:
    - (Qa-2a^3).(2a) = (Qa^2 - a^4)
    - Simplified: 2(Q-2a^2)= Q-a^2, so Q = 3a^2
- Accordingly, as can be derived from the c formula, a* = b* = c* = (Q/3)^0.5 = sqrt (Q/3) = cube
- SOLUTION IS INCOMPLETE without checking the Hessian matrix eigenvalues at critical point! 
    - You should find 2 pure and 1 mixed 2nd derivatives, and confirm a positive definite Hessian

###W09-W1_partd_start_md
**Solution:** The cube

**Proof:**
- Draw on the board a sketch of this shape (simple box), name sides a, b, c (unequal)
    - Total external surface area S = 2( ab+bc+ac )
    - Volume V = abc
- Formal problem: min { ab+bc+ac } (we can simplify by neglecting the const. term two=2)
    - s.t. V = abc (thus, c = V/(ab))
- The bivariate function becomes: min { ab + aV/(ab) + bV/(ab) }
- Critical point: we must determine a* and b* by setting both Jacobian elements to zero:
    - dJ/da = 0, so: b* - V/a*^2 = 0, or b* = V/a*^2
    - dJ/db = 0, so: a* - V/b*^2 = 0, or a* = V/b*^2 
    - Substituting one into the other:
        - a* = b* = c* = (V)^1/3 = cuberoot (V).. cube!
- SOLUTION IS INCOMPLETE without checking the Hessian matrix eigenvalues at critical point!
    - You should find 2 pure and 1 mixed 2nd derivatives, and confirm a pos. definite Hessian

###W09-W1_partf_start_md
**Solution:** The sphere

**(Not quite a) Proof:**
- The problem is ill-defined (: not very specific), but the idea (on the basis of the previous problems) is how to enclose the max. volume for a given surface area.
- A way to approach this is a following: Let's consider the sequence of canonical (Platonic) solids, and compute the V/S (volume-to-ext. surface area) for increasing no. of faces. 
- Accordingly, we evaluate this ratio (V/S) for a tetrahedron (4 faces), cube (6 faces), etc.

Table from http://whistleralley.com/polyhedra/platonic.htm (or any other you wish to find)

- For the sphere (which could be viewed as a platonic solid with an infinite number of faces):
    - Volume = (4/3) $$\pi$$r^3, Surface = 4$$\pi$$r^2, and the value of the V/S coefficient = 1/3.
- This is the highest one, in comparison to all the foregoing ones, and it is a strong indication (not a proof) that the sphere can accommodate the highest volume within a given surface area.
